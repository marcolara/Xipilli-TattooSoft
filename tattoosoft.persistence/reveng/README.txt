README about Ecomzero MyEclipse Templates
Author: Marco Lara

We are using the templates in the "ecomzero-myeclipse_templates_8.5" dir to customize
our reveng process.  Only those templates that are customized have been kept in that 
directory.  However, the full set of customizable templates exists in the accompanying
zip file.

More detail about MyEclipse's templating in the zip file's README.
